# reduced-mass-calc
In this repo I will present the procedure to compute reduced mass, a parameter used as the input in Holstein model Hamiltonian.

The idea is inspired from [this link](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/401370/normal-modes-how-to-get-reduced-masses-from-displacement-vectors-atomic-masses).
